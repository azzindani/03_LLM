      "(B) Conduct at least two public hearings to take place over a period of no fewer than 30 days.\n",
      "(4) (A) The commission shall establish and make available to the public a calendar of all public hearings described in paragraphs (2) and (3). Hearings shall be scheduled at various times and days of the week to accommodate a variety of work schedules and to reach as large an audience as possible.\n",

      "(9) All records of the commission relating to redistricting, and all data considered by the commission in drawing a draft map or the final map, are public records.\n",
      "(d) (1) The commission shall adopt a redistricting plan adjusting the boundaries of the supervisorial districts and shall file the plan with the county elections official before August 15 of the year following the year in which each decennial federal census is taken.\n",
      "(2) The plan shall be effective 30 days after it is filed with the county elections official.\n",
      "(3) The plan shall be subject to referendum in the same manner as ordinances.\n",
      "(4) The commission shall issue, with the final map, a report that explains the basis on which the commission made its decisions in achieving compliance with the criteria described in subdivisions (a) and (b).\n",

Existing law also exempts from civil liability a person or entity that acquires an AED for emergency use, a physician who is involved with the placement of the AED, and any person or entity responsible for the site where the AED is located if specified conditions are met, including maintenance and regular testing of the AED and having a written plan that describes the procedures to be followed in case of an emergency that may involve the use of the AED. Under existing law, those specified conditions also require, when an AED is placed in a public or private K–12 school, the school principal to, among other things, ensure that the school administrators and staff annually receive a brochure, approved as to content and style by the American Heart Association or the American Red Cross, that describes the proper use of an AED, to ensure that similar information is posted next to every AED, and to designate the trained employees who are available to respond to an emergency that may involve the use of an AED during normal operating hours.\\nThis bill would provide an exemption from civil liability for a physician and surgeon or other health care professional that is involved in the selection, placement, or installation of an AED. The bill would require a person or entity, other than a health facility as defined, that acquires an AED to, among other things, comply with specified regulations for the placement of the device and ensure that the AED is maintained and tested as specified.

The bill would also specify that a medical director or physician and surgeon is not required to be involved in the acquisition or placement of an AED. The bill would make related changes.\\nThis bill would revise the public or private K–12 school provisions described above by instead requiring, when an AED is placed in a public or private K–12 school, the school principal to ensure that the school administrators and staff annually receive information that describes sudden cardiac arrest, the school’s emergency response plan, and the proper use of an AED, by instead requiring the school principal to ensure that instructions, in no less than 14-point type, on how to use the AED are posted next to every AED, and by deleting the requirement that the school principal designate the trained employees who are available to respond to an emergency that may involve the use of an AED during normal operating hours.'"
